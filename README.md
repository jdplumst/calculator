This is a calculator created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The calculator works by evaluating a single pair of numbers at a time. For example, if we want to evaluate 12+7-5*3 it would be evaluated as so:

12 + 7 - 5 * 3
= 19 - 5 * 3
= 14 * 3
= 42

The % operator works by entering a number then clicking the % operator. This converts the entered number to a percentage. For example, it would covert 4 to 0.04 and 700 to 7.
